#TouchPDF
TouchPDF is a small and simple PDF viewer for the Nook Simple Touch&reg;.  It features a two-column viewing mode designed for journal articles:

As you know if you own one, the NST has very limited support for PDF documents.  B&N's Reader app attempts to extract reflowable text from the document, destroying all formatting and often displaying an unreadable mess.  TouchPDF takes a completely different approach.  It treats documents as images, not text.  This means there's no selection or searching, but that seems appropriate since I use my NST as a replacement for dead tree media.
  
TouchPDF does not require any special permissions itself, but you'll need to root your NST to install it.  It probably won't work on other devices because the controls are tied to the hardware buttons on the NST.
